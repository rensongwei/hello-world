# hello-world
This is my first repository.

Send someone to love me.
I need to rest in arms.
Keep me safe from harm.
In pouring rain.
Give me endless summer.
Lord i fear the cold.
Feel i'm getting old.
Before my time.
As my soul heals the shame.
I will grow through this pain.
Lord I'm doing all i can.
To be a better man.

GO easy on my conscience.
Cause it's not my fault.
I know I've been taught.
To take the blame.
Rest assured my angels.
Will catch my tears.
Walk me out of here.
I'm in pain.
As my soul heals the shame.
I will grow through this pain.
Lord I'm doing all I can.
TO be a better man.
